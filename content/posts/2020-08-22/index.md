Remember that [bruce almighty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Almighty) scene where Jim Carrey is super productive and answering all the prayers in mere seconds. Something we mere mortals can only wish to do. I really like that scene because of what follows. Turns out just rushing through all the prayers and granting all the wishes is a bad idea.

I feel like I'm seeing articles with tips and tricks to improve my productivity every day. I'm being bombarded with people telling me how I should be seeing productivity. My friends are being affected by all these articles clearly because they keep saying "I should be doing this more" or "I wish I was more productive". To this I would just like to say...

That is some grade A bullshit. I don't think there is an upper bound on productivity that we should be aiming for. And I wish people would stop beating themselves up when they can't reach those. Sometimes I'm very productive and sometimes I'm not. I would really like that to be different. But it's not. And that's ok.

There are lots of good articles about productivity out there. And some of these tips and tricks really help. I think my only advice would really be to take these things with a grain of salt. It might work for you. And it might not. Because you're different than the person who wrote it.

I broke my record for memes in a post. You're welcome.
