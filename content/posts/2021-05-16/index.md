I love inside jokes. There’s so much joy in seeing a comedian make a joke that only a certain subset of people will understand. Or making a joke in a group of friends that means something more to that one other friend. That knowing look or smile is just one of my greatest joys in life.

I’ll be looking at some esoteric comedians who delve more into the extreme irreverence of societal norms. Some people might not agree that these people deserve to be called comedians. That’s fair. Comedy is often extremely subjective. These are just my opinions. I’ll focus on a couple of my favourite artists/creators/actors. Some of these people are more popular than others.

The first is one of the writers of the tv series’ Community and Rick and Morty. Both has gained substantial commercial success. Dan Harmon consistently provides a tv experience that is unique in a world of repetitive content. It’s risky, funny, and constantly pushing boundaries. There are often complex and intricate themes balanced with solid storytelling and genuinely objectively funny scenes.

Next we have Eric Andre. The one word I’d use to describe Eric Andre is irreverent. It seems like this is just what he’d like the world to believe on screen. His show is brilliant, hilarious, crazy, and extremely offensive. I don’t really understand why I like it so much or why he does the things he does. He might not even understand. Just go watch this [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TpDf3me45g) with a guest to see how he makes his guests uncomfortable. And maybe watch an [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XR4Ml8FijM) with the late Larry King to see what goes on inside his head. Behind all this craziness he seems like a really nice person that I’d like to be friends with.

Next we have a man who has a pain tolerance that seems down right alien. If there’s a stunt that seems crazy and impossible or just down right gross then it seems like Steve-o would do it. There’s a nod here to Dirty Sanchez as well but to me, they were taking things that step too far. Nowadays, it seems like Steve-o has calmed down a lot and hosts a surprisingly insightful podcast. Here’s an [episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7HZkGEQLro) with the aforementioned Eric Andre if it tickles your fancy. Or maybe you just want to see him in [pain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yEPXMng9HQ). I don’t judge.

Finally, a friend recently introduced me to Marc Rebillet. He’s a loop musician that captivates you with his sheer enjoyment in making music. Use him as your [alarm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enYdAxVcNZA). Or develop a newfound phobia for [flamingos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hJv5yBLe9c). Or learn about his [favourite thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuMX8Kf3Wyw). Maybe join one of his streams one day. It’s fun. You definitely won’t regret it.

There are many more like the ones mentioned here, but these are definitely the ones that have made a real impact on me. Whether it’s a laugh, an insightful moment or a gasp I’m always entertained with people like this in the world.
