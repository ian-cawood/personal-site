description: "What I've learned this week"

This week has been very strange. I've realized that my opinions on meaning keep changing. I'm not sure if I'll ever have an answer that resonates completely with me. I keep reading and seeing new things that update my fundamental beliefs, which I guess are not so fundamental after all.

I've been reading [Yes to life](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48711165-yes-to-life) by Viktor E. Frankl, and while the title warded me off at first I was excited to read another book by him.  I first read [Man's search for meaning](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4069.Man_s_Search_for_Meaning) which highlights among other things Frankl's days spent surviving the German concentration camps. He has every reason to be bitter and vengeful. You would expect him to be filled with hatred and yet he isn't. I'm heartened by his views of life and it is clear that his studies of the mind are something that brought him meaning. His books have inspired me to reconsider some of my beliefs.

Here are a few videos that really resonated with me this week. One of them made me cry.
- This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8Z5CfKtbXQ) brings me such joy to watch. Brian Mujati is a former professional rugby player. His videos are funny, insightful and surprisingly honest.
- Wisecrack presents well researched thoughts on philosophical and cultural topics. Here's one on [Bill Gates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-fqcFaZKHQ).
- The last one is just for fun. I laughed myself silly. I think we all have a little [shmole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d0j6AWf1NU) in us.

Ends.
