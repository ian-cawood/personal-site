I'm a very private person. Writing calms me down. It doesn't really matter what I write about or who reads it. This is an attempt to share a bit more about things that happen in my everyday life.

I work as a software engineer and I really enjoy what I do. It's easily one of the most fulfilling things I have done. Learning new things on a daily basis is extremely stimulating. Unknown problems are exhilarating. It's stressful as well, and it can be difficult to deal with client and personal demands, but it remains highly rewarding.

I learn many new things every week and I'm fortunate to work with a talented group of people at [nona](https://nona.digital/#), who further my development even more. Here are a few cool things that I've learnt this week:

- [multi-stage](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/) builds for docker are really cool.
- nginx [reverse-proxy](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/reverse-proxy/) works nicely for hosting multiple websites on one server, on one port. I hope to write more on this since I had some trouble with setting this up nicely.
- it really pays to read documentation thoroughly, otherwise I might have never known that the nginx docker image supports [custom config with templates](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/tree/master/nginx#using-environment-variables-in-nginx-configuration-new-in-119).

Thank you for your attention. I will now present you with a topical gif.
