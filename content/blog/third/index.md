description: "Transitions into the Ops"
---

I've been transitioning into a new role (more ops than dev) at work for the last year. And it's terrifying. I now need to do things that no one else has done before. The internet has no answers.

The issues I've been facing are mostly to do with an excess of information. When using a programming language the surface area feels a lot smaller when solving a problem. You have very defined bounds within which to work. To me the bounds when working with infrastructure are broad. And this is most likely because I still don't know enough.

To try to keep myself sane and grounded, I've been relying on friends and colleagues and keeping defined boundaries between work and downtime. The latter has been really hard. I find myself searching/learning/exploring work concepts on my personal computer a fair amount. This is not entirely healthy because there might never be time for switching off. On the other hand I really don't mind it much because I'm really interested in these topics.

It's been an exciting year work-wise and I've been enjoying the seemingly insurmountable mountain of information thrown at me. So while we're all trying to ignore the dumpster fire that is the world right now, I'm going to keep reading/learning/experimenting.

Here's some cool stuff:
- [doef doef](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mj4cD5xn2n0) is the afrikaans club banger we all need.
- The [cloud native foundation](https://www.cncf.io/) is wonderful for the world of software. Here's a short [definition](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/DEFINITION.md) of what it's about.
