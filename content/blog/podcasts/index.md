Alright so let's get one thing very clear right from the get go. This is not advice. Or a good way of doing things. I don't even know how I ended up here. There are so many podcasts out there that there are podcasts talking about how to choose podcasts. We've reached something that TV went through ages ago. And before that movies. And before that radio. Ok we get the point.

So to the point now. I find a lot of these podcasts incredibly boring, monotonous and extremely verbose. And sometimes very funny, endearing, informative and concise. So mostly I've started using podcasts to bore/soothe myself to sleep. I'm not even sure how it started. It started out so innocently listening to a podcast before bed to relax and get some information while my eyes are closed. If only I could close my eyes while sitting. But what kind of maniac does that.

Anyway I'm trying to shake this habit by putting my phone away before bed. It's been going ok until I found a loophole this week by using the laptop instead. So clearly my crafty mind is getting one over on me. So all electronics are now banned from my bedroom. Yes even wireless earphones. Take that brain.
