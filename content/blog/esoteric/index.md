> esoteric: likely to be understood only by people with a special knowledge or interest.

It's a good time right now for the esoteric. There is more content being created than ever before. Information is growing at an exponential rate. And will probably continue to grow like this for the forseeable future. And with this barrage of information comes popular websites like [4chan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4chan) and [reddit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit) where you can find just about any interest group you can imagine. Whether it's a meme or a music group you can bet that someone knows the intimate back story of this topic and has written about it. Even if it could be made up.

So without much ado or any fanfare I'm just going to share some of my favorite esoteric finds of the year. Some people may know these and some people may understand it (I sure as hell (what a weird saying) don't understand all of it).

- This wonderful [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hJv5yBLe9c&ab_channel=MarcRebillet) gives us a look into the life of a flamingo. I mean not really but it's pretty funny.
- [Eric Andre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKi908jvW-I) is definitely worth a watch. I'm not sure what's going on but his talk show always glues me to the screen for a glorious 11 minutes.
- Flight of the Concords are great and this [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY8jaGs7xJ0) is probably the best way to ask for a threesome.
