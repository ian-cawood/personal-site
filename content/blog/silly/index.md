Silly movies and comedy sketches are the best. There might be some bias in that statement but I honestly don't care, this is the hill where I will fight to the death. Where I will throw my holy hand grenade.

Whenever I feel down and a bit gloomy I think of the classics that never fail to make me laugh. I don't have an exhaustive list but these are a few of my favorites:

- [Monty Python and the Holy Grail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python_and_the_Holy_Grail) is simply put a masterpiece. I know of no man that stands his ground like the black knight.
- [Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talladega_Nights:_The_Ballad_of_Ricky_Bobby) is first because it cannot be last. It's low brow and it's amazing.
- The [imagination land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginationland_Episode_I) series of episodes in South Park is absolutely ludicrous. And just plain funny.
- [Blades of Glory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blades_of_Glory) made me laugh so much it was embarrassing.
- [Robin hood: Men in Tights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Hood:_Men_in_Tights) is perhaps my favorite. I remember watching it for the first time with my family. Proving that funny doesn't need to be vulgar. I still remember my dad canning himself.
- [The badman series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDdHYjb5sBk) that's right not the serious, dramatic and epic Christopher Nolan series. I'm talking about the Pete Holmes hilariously stupid batman rendition. Take the time.

I have many more examples. But I want these to stand by themselves. For modern sketches I think the Key & Peele series was a masterpiece. This [substitute teacher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dd7FixvoKBw) doesn't need your guidance on pronunciation and this [gangster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BFSLPjUCUU) takes pride to its logical conclusion.

I can't finish this without mentioning [Rowan Atkinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowan_Atkinson) and his contribution to silly. The man is a legend.
